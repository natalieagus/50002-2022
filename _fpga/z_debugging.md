# Debugging the FPGA

This document is written to guide you with debugging the FPGA using Alchitry Lab's debug feature. That said, there's nothing wrong using outputs such as the LEDS or 7-segment display to debug. Use which ever method you prefer.

## Capture Signals

### Debug Project

Start by selecting the `Debug Project` (bug looking icon) in the toolbar.

### Select Signals

Select the signals you would like to capture during debugging by ticking the respective checkboxes.

> Example to debug FSM current state (`0`-indexed in output)

> Example to debug REGFILE read addresses and output

### Build Project

Build the project by clicking on `Debug`.

Wait patiently... very patiently...

### Load Project

Once the build has completed, load the project onto the FPGA by clicking the `Program (Flash)` button.

### Wait

Wait for the FPGA to start up.

### Open Wave Capture

Open the `Wave Capture` tab by going to `Tools > Wave Capture`.

### Connect and Capture

Click on `Connect` (left button) followed by `Capture` (right button).

### View Signals

You should now be able to view the signals you selected earlier. Hover over the signal lines to view the values in decimal or expand the view to see each individual bit.

### Capture At Will

You are now able to capture the signals at any point in time during execution by clicking on the `Capture` button in the `Wave Capture` tab.

**_Good luck debugging!_**
