# Getting Good with FPGA: Building the Beta CPU

This document is created for the sake of enhancing our understanding in how basic CPU works by actually implementing it onto an FPGA. We will create our 32-bit $$\beta$$ CPU and use simple dual-port RAM to simulate some of the instructions that we have learned in class and **test** if they're working properly.

You are recommended to read this document only after you've understood **completely** up until the chapter on $$\beta$$ datapath and are comfortable enough with HDL programming:

- You're **confident** with your understanding about sequential logic and synchronization.
- You're **comfortable** with how memory read and write works, and memory addressing.
- You **know** how to use common components like `counter`, `edge detector`, `button conditioner`, and `fsm` properly.

> If not, please brush up your FPGA programming knowledge by starting with [this](https://natalieagus.github.io/computationstructures/fpga/fpga_1) document instead.

The completed project can be found <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/tree/master/BetaComponents" target="_blank">here</a>, if you want to dive into it right away.

## Creating a Memory Unit

You can use a bunch of `dff`s as a memory unit, but its going to take a lot of the logic cells of your FPGA. Let's do the math:

- The $$\beta$$ CPU is a 32-bit architecture.
- If you want your memory unit to support 128 words, then you need 32 $$\times$$ 128 `dff`s = 4096 `dff`s. If we're being optimistic and assume that 1 `dff` use 1 logic cell, that's alot of logic cells used simply for the memory unit (about 12% of the Au's cells).

We shall use another component instead: `simple_ram` or `simple_dual_ram`. The difference is that in `simple_dual_ram` you can perform read and write at the same clock cycle, whereas in `simple_ram` you only have 1 address port for _either_ read or write.

To create a memory unit, you can first import the component `simple_dual_ram` (under _memory_) to your project. You can instantiate a memory unit like this:

```cpp
simple_dual_ram memory_unit(#SIZE(16), #DEPTH(128), .wclk(clk), .rclk(clk)); // 128 entries (words), 16 bits each
```

- The parameter `#SIZE`(word size) and `#DEPTH`(entries) can be set accordingly, depending on how many bits you want to have per entry.
- `wclk` and `rclk` are read and write clk. You can set it to be the same as the system clock.

You need to always supply these four inputs to the memory unit. The names are explanatory:

```cpp
memory_unit.waddr = <write address>;
memory_unit.write_en = <1 or 0>; // 1 for write, 0 otherwise
memory_unit.write_data = <data to be written>;
memory_unit.raddr = <read address>;
```

Then it will produce the output:

```cpp
out = memory_unit.read_data;
```

- The memory unit is **always reading**, depending on what is the current `<read address>`. You can simply ignore the `.read_data` if you don't need it.

- Number of bits for `.raddr` / `waddr` is $$\log_2$$(`DEPTH`).
- **Important** documentation:
  - <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">`.read_data` always produces the output from `.raddr` supplied in the previous clock cycle. </span> The documentation says that if you supplied address `A` at `t=0`, then at `t=1` (next clock cycle), `Mem[A]` is produced at `.read_data` port.
  - <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black"> If you perform **read and write** to the **same location** at the **same clock cycle** e.g: at`t=0`, the result of the data written will be observed only **two clock cycles later** at `t=2`. _At `t=1`, the old data is still produced at the read port._

You can familiarise yourself first with how the memory unit works using an `fsm`.

- Perform some writes onto the memory unit, and then
- Get input address `.raddr` from one of the `io_dip`
- Route the output `.read_data` onto one of the `io_led`

Refer to this <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/GettingStartedWithFPGA/source/ramtester.luc" target="_blank">RAM tester</a> module to see how it may be done.

Then, in `au_top.luc` add the following code:

```cpp
// instantiate the module
ramtester ram(.clk(clk));
button_conditioner buttonconditioner(.clk(clk));
edge_detector buttonedge (#RISE(1), #FALL(0), .clk(clk));

//... in always block
io_led[0] = io_dip[0]; // connect the DIP switches to the LEDs to observe read address
io_led[0][7] = io_button[0]; // use io_button[0] to "write" data

ram.read_address = io_dip[0][5:0]; // set for read address
ram.write_address = io_dip[1][5:0]; // set for write address
ram.data = c{h00, io_dip[2]}; // set for write data
buttonconditioner.in = io_button[0];  // condition button
buttonedge.in = buttonconditioner.out; // get rising edge
ram.button_enter = buttonedge.out; // pass to ram

io_led[2] = ram.out[15:8]; // show 16-bit ram content over both io_leds
io_led[1] = ram.out[7:0];
```

**How `ram_tester` is used based on the setting above in `au_top.luc`:**

- Four data in address `b000000, b000001, b000010, b000011` are pre-written by the `fsm` in `ram_tester`. They contain the data: `hFFFF, h0FFF, h00FF, h000F` respectively. _This is to demonstrate auto write at the beginning (startup)._

- You can use the least 5 bits of `io_dip[0]` to set `.radr` and observe the output at `io_led[2]` and `io_led[1]`.
- You can write custom data too. Set write address using `io_dip[1]` and write adata using `io_dip[2]` (won't be shown on any led). Then press `io_button[0]` to allow the ram to "_write_".
  > Test it by reading using the same address (set `io_dip[0]` to be equal to `io_dip[1]` when you wrote the data).

Now that we understand how the `simple_ram` module works, lets create a module that corresponds to this memory unit in the $$\beta$$ schematic shown our notes:

> Note: there's two read ports (`id`, `mrd`), and one write port (`mwd`). Each port requires the corresponding address to write or read to.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/beta/memory.png"  class="center_full"/>

Create a new script `memoryunit.luc` and define the terminals as follows. The names are self explanatory.

```cpp
// supports byte addressable
module memoryunit #(
  DEPTH = 16 // entries in the memory
)
(
    input clk,  // clock

    // for data memory
    input raddr[$clog2(DEPTH)+2],
    input waddr[$clog2(DEPTH)+2],
    input data_memory_input[32],
    input xwr,
    output data_memory_output[32],

    // for instruction memory
    input ia[$clog2(DEPTH)+2],
    input instruction_write_enable,
    input instruction_towrite[32],
    output instruction[32]
  )
```

We will create two `ram` units as _instruction_ memory and **data** memory. In practice they're supposed to be the **same** memory unit but we don't have a `ram` module with **two read ports** by default, we have to make do with the modules that are available:

> Actually since we will never perform data read and data write at the same time, we technically can use `simple_ram` instead of `simple_dual_ram` for `data_memory`, but we just want to illustrate the usage for both here.

```cpp
{
  simple_ram instruction_memory(#SIZE(32), #DEPTH(16), .clk(clk)); // can fit 16 * 32 bits
  simple_dual_ram data_memory(#SIZE(32), #DEPTH(16), .wclk(clk), .rclk(clk)); // can fit 16 * 32 bits

  always {

    instruction_memory.write_data = instruction_towrite;
    instruction_memory.address = ia[$clog2(DEPTH)+2-1:2]; // memory_unit is word addressable in Lucid, ignore two LSB
    instruction_memory.write_en = instruction_write_enable;
    instruction = instruction_memory.read_data;

    data_memory.raddr = raddr[$clog2(DEPTH)+2-1:2]; // memory_unit is word addressable in Lucid, ignore two LSB
    data_memory.waddr = waddr[$clog2(DEPTH)+2-1:2];// memory_unit is word addressable in Lucid, ignore two LSB
    data_memory.write_data = data_memory_input;
    data_memory.write_en = xwr;
    data_memory_output = data_memory.read_data;
  }
}
```

Then in the `always` block we simply make the correct connections. One thing to pay attention to is the fact that $$\beta$$ assumes byte-addressable memory unit but the `ram` modules uses **word addressing.**

Therefore we need to **truncate** the two LSB off the addresses supplied by $$\beta$$: `ia` (instruction address), `radr` and `wadr` (read and write address to the data memory, both are supplied by the same source the output of the `ALU`).

The complete implementation of `memory_unit.luc` can be found <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/memoryunit.luc
" target="_blank">here</a>.

## The ALU

The ALU is a combinational logic unit, so creating it is pretty straightforward.

> Just remember that in this document we are recreating the original $$\beta$$ CPU (32-bit architecture) so we need to create a `32-bit` ALU instead of the `16-bit` we used for 1D project.

We need to ensure that it performs the right operation given an `ALUFN` input. The unit should have the following input and output terminals:

> Don't forget that `zvn` signals are the also formal **output** of the `alu`.

```cpp
module alu (
    	input a[32],
    	input b[32],
    	input alufn_signal[6],
    	output out[32],
    	output zvn[3]
  ) )
```

To make it more interesting, we can follow how we create the ALU in the course lab (instead of writing a bunch of if-elses according to `alufn_signal` combinations). Create four modules: `adder.luc`, `boolean.luc`, `shifter.luc`, and `compare.luc`, and implement its functionalities.

> _The input and output terminals of each module should be exactly as defined in our Lab 3: ALU._
>
> Refer to these completed scripts if you're stuck: <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/adder.luc" target="_blank">adder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/boolean.luc" target="_blank">boolean</a>, <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/shifter.luc" target="_blank">shifter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/compare.luc" target="_blank">compare</a>.

Then assemble all of them in the `alu.luc` module where you instantiate all of them:

```cpp
adder adderUnit;
boolean booleanUnit;
shifter shifterUnit;
compare compareUnit;

sig z;
sig v;
sig n;
```

...and implement the connections in the `always` block, for instance here's the connection between the `adder` and the `compare` unit:

```cpp
adderUnit.alufn_signal = alufn_signal;
adderUnit.a = a;
adderUnit.b = b;

z = adderUnit.z;
v = adderUnit.v;
n = adderUnit.n;

zvn[0] = z;
zvn[1] = v;
zvn[2] = n;

compareUnit.alufn_signal = alufn_signal;
compareUnit.z = z;
compareUnit.v = v;
compareUnit.n = n;
```

You can find the complete implementation of `alu.luc` <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/alu.luc" target="_blank">here</a>.

## The Regfile Unit

The `REGFILE` unit has 32 `32-bit` registers, where each register is 5-bit addressable. We have 2 combinational read ports and 1 sequential write port. Also, our special register `R31` should always return `32b0` when read, and writing to `R31` should not change its value (it remains zero). The schematic for the `REGFILE` is:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/beta/regfile_detailed.png"  class="center_full"/>

We can easily create a module for this unit using `dff`. Create a script called `regfile.luc` with the same I/O terminals:

```cpp
 module regfile (
    input clk,  // clock
    input read_address_1[5],
    input read_address_2[5],
    output read_data_1[32],
    output read_data_2[32],
    input write_address[5],
    input write_data[32],
    input write_enable
  )
```

Then we instantiate 32 32-bit `dff`s to represent `R1` to `R31`. The `REGFILE` always performs a _read_ at all times, so you can always ignore its output later on if you don't need it.

> Of course we can just instantiate 31 `dff` instead of 32. Its your choice. Regardless, always make sure that writing to `R31` doesn't have any effect, and reading from `R31` always result in `32b0`.

```cpp
{
  dff registers[32][32](.clk(clk));
  always {
    //always read
    read_data_1 = registers.q[read_address_1];
    read_data_2 = registers.q[read_address_2];

    // check if write_en and its not R31
    if (write_address != b11111 && write_enable){
        registers.d[write_address] = write_data;
    }

    // check if its not R31
    if (read_address_1 == b11111) read_data_1 = h0000;
    if (read_address_2 == b11111) read_data_2 = h0000;
  }
}
```

The complete implementation of `regfile.luc` can be found <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/regfile.luc" target="_blank">here</a>.

## The Control Unit

Now our job is to create the control unit module. Here's the schematic of the `CU`:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/beta/cu.png"  class="center_full"/>

The small 1-bit register's job is to sample an **asynchronous interrupt signal.** We can use a 1-bit `dff` for this:

```cpp
{
	dff irq_sampler(#INIT(0), .clk(clk));
always {
	irq_sampler.d = irq;
	}
}
```

To produce the right control signals given an `opcode`, we can utilize a ROM (64 entries, 18 bits per entry as defined in the Beta lab handout).

Remember the addressing for a ROM in Lucid is as follows:

```cpp
// usage: CU_ROM[opcode]
const CU_ROM = {
        b011100000000000100, // OPCODE 111111 (illop)
        b000000110001101100, // OPCODE 011110 (SRAC)
        b000000110000101100, // OPCODE 011101 (SHRC)
        ....
        b011100000000000100,
        b011100000000000100,// OPCODE 000001 (illop)
        b011100000000000100	// OPCODE 000000 (illop)
        };
```

We then need to handle the `pcsel` value for `bne/beq` case separately:

```cpp
    // beq bne handling
    if (opcode == b011101 && z == 1){//BEQ, branch if z == 1
      pcsel = b001;
    }
    else if (opcode == b011110 && z == 0){ //BNE, branch if z != 1
      pcsel = b001;
    }
```

Similarly, `reset` and `irq` cases have to be handled separately. They have to be written at the **end** of the `always` block _(highest priority)._

```cpp
    // force xwr = 0 when reset == 1
    if (reset){
      xwr = 0;
      werf = 0;
    }

    // interrupt checker, will overwrite everything hence we put at the bottom
    if (irq_sampler.q == 1){
      pcsel = b100;
      wasel = 1;
      werf = 1;
      wdsel = b00;
      xwr = 0;
    }
```

The complete implementation of `control_unit.luc` can be found <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/blob/master/BetaComponents/source/control_unit.luc" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Assembling the Beta

Now that we have all the three major components: the alu, the control unit, and the regfile, we can assemble the rest of the parts together to form a complete $$\beta$$ CPU. Its complete schematic is shown below:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/beta/beta.png"  class="center_full"/>

Create a new script `beta_cpu.luc` with the following I/O terminals:

```cpp
module beta_cpu (
    input clk,  // clock
    input slowclk,
    input rst,
    input interrupt,
    input instruction[32],
    input mem_data_input[32],
    output ia[32],
    output mem_data_address[32],
    output mem_data_output[32],
    output xwr,
    // for debug, connect it to show any output
    output debug[32]
  )
```

> The `slowclk` is used to _slow down_ the rate at which the content of `pcreg` is changed, so that we can **have enough time** to **observe** the output and test our device. It is an input signal that produces a `1` **once** every second and `0` otherwise.
>
> All the I/O terminals of the $$\beta$$ CPU will be connected to the memory unit later on in `au_top.luc`.

Then, declare all major components for the $$\beta$$ CPU that we have previously created. `pc` register can be created as a 32-bit `dff`:

```cpp
  control_unit control_system(.clk(clk));
  alu alu_system;
  regfile regfile_system(.clk(clk));
  dff pc[32](#INIT(0),.clk(clk));
```

In the `always` block, we can start connecting them. As we have learned in the previous tutorial, we can use `case` to simulate the behaviour of a multiplexer (for the `asel`, `bsel`, `ra2sel`, `wdsel`, and `wasel` muxes).

For example, here's how you can create the `asel` mux:

```cpp
    alu_system.alufn_signal = control_system.alufn;
    case(control_system.asel){
      b0:
        alu_system.a = regfile_system.read_data_1;
      b1:
        alu_system.a = pc.q + 4 + 4 * c{instruction[15], instruction[15:0]};
      default:
        alu_system.a = regfile_system.read_data_1;
    }
```

... and here's how you can create the `wasel` mux:

```cpp
    case(control_system.wasel){
      b0:
        regfile_system.write_address = instruction[25:21];
      b1:
        regfile_system.write_address = b11110;
      default:
        regfile_system.write_address = instruction[25:21];
    }
```

In order for us to **observe** the output, we need to slow down the rate of change of `ia` supplied by `pc` register. We can do this by triggering a change in `pc.d` only when `slowclk == b1`.

> Note: `pc` reg produces a _new_ `ia` at the time when `slowclk == b1` + 1 system `clk` period and the output of the $$\beta$$ stays the same until the next `slowclk == b1` is triggered, hence giving us enough time to study it.

```cpp
if (slowclk){
   // PCSEL mux
   case (control_system.pcsel){
      b000:
        pc.d = pc.q + 4;
      b001:
        pc.d = pc.q + 4 + 4 * c{instruction[15], instruction[15:0]};
      b010:
        // protect jump
        pc.d = c{pc.q[31] && regfile_system.read_data_1[31],regfile_system.read_data_1[30:0]};
      b011:
        pc.d = h00000008; // illop
      b100:
        pc.d = h00000004; // irq
      default:
        pc.d = pc.q;
    }
}
```

<span style="background-color:yellow; color: black"> Some details: </span> **remember that we need to wait for 1 `clk` cycle** _after_ we supply the `ram` with some read address `ia` for it to produce the correct output (which is the current _instruction_ stored at `Mem[ia]`).

- The `control_unit`'s output depends on the `6-bit` opcode embedded in the _instruction_.

- We need to ensure that the computation of `control_system.pcsel` is based on the correct _current_ opcode, that is the opcode obtained _after_ there's a valid data read out `Mem[ia]` from the `ram`.

- Therefore the `slowclk` must trigger the block above **only after** at least 1 period of actual `clk` _has passed._ We can do this by ensuring that `slowclk` **starts** with a valid voltage low (`0`) -- and let some cycles of system `clk` run first.

  > A foolproof way: create an `N` bit counter and take the value of its highest bit (passed through an `edge_detector`) as the `slowclk` signal.

  > Well, you can also try creating a `counter` with a `#DIV`, but you have to check beforehand whether the first signal produced by this counter is `0` or `1`. If it is a `1`, then there's a chance that in the beginning the block above is triggered at the same time the `clk` is triggered, resulting in `pc` reg latching on the wrong output from `control_system.pcsel` because `instruction[31:26]` is not yet ready -- only ready in the follow `clk` cycle.

- Fetching/reading of _instructions_ in the subsequent cycle will not result in any issue because _new_ `instruction[31:26]` will be ready in 1 `clk` cycle after `slowclk` is triggered, and will stay valid until the time the next `slowclk` is triggered.
  > This is assuming of course that `slowclk` will be much slower than `clk`.

Finally, you can utilize the debug port to display any values that might be useful for debugging if you encounter some unexpected behaviour, for example to check if `pcsel` computation is correct:

```cpp
//for debug
debug = control_system.pcsel;
```

## Testing the Beta CPU

The final step is of course to test the Beta CPU. In order to test it, we need to first **load** some instructions to the `memory_unit`, and set `beta.rst= b1` while loading is happening. Only after loading is done then we can run the CPU. We can do this easily with the help of a simple `fsm`.

### Instruction Loading

Create a simple `fsm` at `au_top.luc`, and the beta components, along with necessary components to produce `slowclk`:

```cpp
beta_cpu beta(.clk(clk));
counter slowclock(#SIZE(27), .clk(clk), .rst(rst));
edge_detector slowclockedge(#RISE(1), #FALL(0), .clk(clk));
memoryunit memory_unit(#DEPTH(16), .clk(clk)); // can fit 16 * 32 bits

fsm code_writer(.clk(clk)) = {INSTRUCTIONLOAD, WAIT, GO};
```

Suppose we want to load the following instructions to be executed by the Beta:

```cpp
ADDC(R31, 7, R1)
CMPEQ(R1, R1, R2)
ST(R1, 32)
LD(R31, 32, R3)
BNE(R3, 0, R1)
```

You can use `bsim` to obtain the 32-bit machine language form for each instruction, and then store it as some constant. We also need to ensure that the instructions are **loaded** to the memory_unit first upon startup before we can run the `beta`. We can use some `dff`: `writer_counter` to keep track which instruction has been loaded to the memory unit.

> The rightmost instruction will be loaded to the memory_unit address `0x0`, and the leftmost instruction will be loaded at address `0x10` (byte addressing).

```cpp
const SAMPLE_CODE = {32h7823FFFB, 32h607F0020, 32h643F0020, 32h90410800, 32hC03F0007};

const NUMBER_OF_INSTR = 5;
dff writer_counter[$clog2(NUMBER_OF_INSTR)](.clk(clk));
```

During instruction loading, we need to set `beta.rst=1` as well to easily prevent it from _running_:

```cpp
// write some values to RAM first, then run the beta
case(code_writer.q){
    // instruction loading
    code_writer.INSTRUCTIONLOAD:
        beta.rst = 1;
        writer_counter.d = writer_counter.q + 1;
        memory_unit.instruction_towrite = SAMPLE_CODE[writer_counter.q];
        memory_unit.instruction_write_enable = b1;
        memory_unit.ia = writer_counter.q<<2; // pad with two zeroes to make it byte addressable
        if (writer_counter.q == NUMBER_OF_INSTR){
            code_writer.d = code_writer.WAIT; // wait one more clock cycle to allow the last instruction to be loaded before start execution
        }

	// ensure the last write to the memory_unit is latched
    code_writer.WAIT:
        beta.rst = 1;
        code_writer.d = code_writer.GO;

    // run the beta
    code_writer.GO:
      code_writer.d = code_writer.GO;
}

```

Note: although `writer_counter.q` currently produces 3 bits of data, `memory_unit.ia` accepts 6 bits of data. The output `writer_counter.q` will be padded by 3 zeroes in its higher bits to make the connection match.

The line:`memory_unit.ia = writer_counter.q<<2` simply shifts to the left the output of `writer_counter.q`, so that its output will be incremented by `4` instead of by `1` after each cycle, e.g: `000000`, `000100`, `001000`, `01100`, `10000` since `memory_unit` accepts **byte addressing.**

> As an alternative, you can simply create a `writer_counter` dff of size 5 bits instead of 3 bits, and simply define `writer_counter.d = writer_counter.q + 4;`.

If you want to load other series of instructions, write them in `const SAMPLE_CODE`.

### Connecting Memory Unit with the Beta

Connecting `memory_unit` with `beta` is actually pretty straightforward. We can do that in the `always` block of `au_top.luc`:

```cpp
  beta.instruction = memory_unit.instruction;
  beta.mem_data_input = memory_unit.data_memory_output;
  memory_unit.ia = beta.ia[31:0];
  memory_unit.data_memory_input = beta.mem_data_output;
  memory_unit.xwr = beta.xwr;
  // same address used to read or write from data_memory in memory unit
  memory_unit.waddr = beta.mem_data_address[31:0];
  memory_unit.raddr = beta.mem_data_address[31:0];
```

Then take care of `irq`, `reset`, and `slowclk` inputs for `beta`:

```cpp
slowclockedge.in = slowclock.value[26];
beta.interrupt = 0;
beta.slowclk = slowclockedge.out;
beta.rst = 0;
```

### Connect to I/O

The easiest way to observe the output of `beta` and determining whether it wors properly is by utilizing the leds on Alchitry Io. Here's one recommendation:

```cpp
  // for debug
  io_led[0] = beta.ia[7:0]; //current pc value
  io_led[1] = beta.mem_data_address[7:0]; //output of the ALU
  io_led[2] = beta.mem_data_output[7:0]; //output of the rb_data

  led[7:2] = memory_unit.instruction[31:26]; //current instruction opcode
  led[2:0] = memory_unit.data_memory_output; //32 bit output from data memory
```

Instruction loading should happen pretty fast that we won't even notice it. The first instruction to be executed is `ADDC(R31, 7, R1)`, hence the output that you should see is as follows:
<br>
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/d4jc6s59uvkpinc/instr_pc0.png?raw=1"  ><br>

- `PC` register is at `0x0`
- `ALU` output is `0x7`
- ..and `rb_data` output is `0x0` (since all registers in the `REGFILE` initially contains `0`).

One second later, you should see this output due to instruction `CMPEQ(R1, R1, R2)`:
<br>
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/fi6d5htp5drqakh/instr_pc1.png?raw=1"  ><br>

- `PC` register is at `0x4`
- `ALU` output is `0x1` because comparing the same register contents should always result in a `1`
- ..and `rb_data` output is `0x7` (showing that loading `7` to `R1` in the previous cycle is successful)

The third instruction `ST(R1, 32)` should result in this output:
<br>
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/reihm5lswrjhabw/instr_pc2.png?raw=1"  ><br>

- `PC` register is at `0x8`
- `ALU` output is `0x20` because that's the address that we're storing to (`32` in decimal)
- ..and `rb_data` output is `0x7` (showing that implementation of `ra2sel` mux is successful)

Let's test whether the value `0x7` was properly stored to the `data_memory` by loading it in the next cycle with this instruction: `LD(R31, 32, R3)`. The output that we should see is:
<br>
<img src="https://dropbox.com/s/cvyt1m24xk814ge/instr_pc3.png?raw=1"  ><br>

- `PC` register is at `0xC`
- `ALU` output is `0x20` because that's the address that we're loading from (`32` in decimal)
- ..and `rb_data` output is `0x0` (content of `R0` as per `instruction[16:11]`)

And then perform a branch based on the content of `R3`: `BNE(R3, 0, R1)`. This should result in a branch if the load was successful, as `Reg[R3]` will be nonzero. The output you should see is:
<br><img src="https://dropbox.com/s/0it220j8pjxd82d/instr_pc4.png?raw=1"  ><br>

- `PC` register is at `0x10`
- `asel` is set to `1` during `BNE` (actually it doesnt matter what `asel` is) and this routes `PC+4+4*SXT(c)` to `ALU`'s output. The effective "target" address if `BNE` is successful is `0` and therefore `ALU` output that shows `0` above is _correct_
- ..and `rb_data` output is `0x0` (content of `R0` as per `instruction[16:11]`)

You can try running other series of instruction to test whether other parts of the `beta` implemented is correct, e.g: `illop` triggering instructions to check if `wasel` mux is correctly implemented, `JMP` related instructions, etc.

## Summary

As mentioned in the introduction, the completed project can be found <a href="https://github.com/natalieagus/SampleAlchitryProjects/tree/master/BetaComponents" target="_blank">here</a>. You can carefully craft some instruction sequences to check if certain parts of the `beta` is correctly implemented or not.

Below are some things that each instruction in the sample above are testing:

1. `ADDC(R31, 7, R1)`, `CMPEQ(R1, R1, R2)`:

   - Tests if all related control signals like `wdsel`, `asel` and `bsel` signals for `opc` operations are correctly produced, and each muxes are correctly connected.
   - Tests if writing to `REGFILE` is successful.

2. `ST(R1, 32)`, `LD(R31, 32, R3)`: tests if read and write to the `data_memory` section in external `memory_unit` is successful.

3. `BNE(R3, 0, R1)`: tests if branching can be done, and the `control_unit` processes `z` properly.

There certainly still some things that can be improved in the sample project to minimise the number of logic cells required. If you have some spare time you can try to implement `beta` with less number of logic cells, or clean up the code (eliminate some unused I/O terminal, etc). You can also try to design similar general-purpose programmable datapath for your 1D project, and run it with a series of instruction instead of hardcoding it with an `fsm` (but if you do choose the latter its alright as well, no penalty imposed).
