The lab will reinforce your understanding on how you can build the circuit to conform to the logic that you want, e.g: adder circuit will perform binary addition of input A and B, etc, and make it **PROGRAMMABLE** using the control signal: `ALUFN`.

## Introduction

_(you really should’ve read the [Appendix](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/lab/lab3#appendix-jsim-tricks) of this handout before coming to class)_

In this lab, we will build the **arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)** for the Beta processor.

> The ALU is a **combinational** logic device that has two **32-bit inputs** (which we will call “A” and “B”) and produces one **32-bit output**.
> We will start by designing each piece of the ALU as a separate circuit (Task A and B), each producing its own 32-bit output.
> We will then combine these outputs into a single ALU result (Task C).

Before we begin, there are a few more JSim tricks provided as [Appendix](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/lab/lab3#appendix-jsim-tricks) in this handout that you have to know to make it easier to build such a huge programmable device.

## Task A: Design the ALU Components

The arithmetic logic unit is the **heart** of a **CPU**; it is responsible for all sorts of **logic computations**. The basic family of operations that a general-purpose ALU should have include:

- **Addition/subtraction** for basic arithmetic computation
- **Comparison** for branching purposes
- **Boolean** unit for boolean computation, like XOR, bit masking, etc
- **Shifter** unit for division or multiplication by 2, or chopping data apart
- **Multiplier** unit for multiplication

In this lab, we will attempt to create a simple ALU circuit. It is one of the components inside our Beta CPU. We will eventually utilise our work here to build an entire Beta CPU circuit in the next lab (Lab 5).

<div class="redbox"><div class="custom_box">**Important Note:**

$$
ALUFN \neq OPCODE
$$

The ALUFN signals used to **control** the operation of the ALU circuitry use an encoding chosen to make the design of the ALU circuitry as simple as possible. This encoding is **_not_** the same as the one used to encode the 6-bit OPCODE field of Beta instructions. In Lab 5, you will build some logic (actually a ROM) that will translate the opcode field of an instruction into the appropriate ALUFN control bits. </div></div><br>

### Part 1: Adder / Subtractor

Design an **adder/subtractor** unit that operates on 32-bit two’s complement (**SIGNED**) inputs (`A[31:0]`, `B[31:0]`) and generates a 32-bit output (`S[31:0]`) + 3-bit _other_ output signal (`Z, V, N`).

It will be useful to generate three other output signals to be used by the comparison logic in Part B:

- `Z` which is true when the S outputs are all zero
- `V` which is true when the addition operation overflows (i.e., the result is too large to be represented in 32 bits), and
- `N` which is true when the S is negative (i.e., S31 = 1).

The following schematic is a big picture for how to go about the design:

> We will be using the “little-endian” bit numbering convention where bit 31 is the most-significant bit and bit 0 is the least-significant bit.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/3.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

- The `ALUFN0` input signal selects whether the operation is an `ADD` or `SUBTRACT`.
  - `ALUFN0` will be set to `0` for an `ADD (S = A + B)` and `1` for a `SUBTRACT (S = A – B)`;
  - To do a `SUBTRACT`, the circuit first computes the two’s complement negation of the “B” operand by inverting “B” and then adding one (which can be done by forcing the carry-in of the 32-bit add to be 1).
- `A[31:0]` and `B[31:0]` are the 32-bit two’s complement (SIGNED) **input** operands;
- `S[31:0]` is the 32-bit **output**;
- `Z/V/N` are the three **other output** code bits described above.

> Start by implementing the 32-bit add using a ripple-carry architecture. You’ll have to construct the 32-input NOR gate required to compute Z using a tree of smaller fan-in gates (the parts library only has gates with up to 4 inputs).

#### Computing Overflow

**Overflow** can never occur when the two operands to the addition have **different** signs; if the two operands have the same sign, then overflow can be detected if the sign of the result differs from the **sign** of the operands (Note that `XA` and `XB` are just the input nodes of the `FA`, refer to the diagram above):

$$
\begin{align*}
V = &XA_{31} \cdot XB_{31} \cdot \overline{S_{31}} + \overline{XA_{31}} \cdot \overline{XB_{31}} \cdot S_{31}
\end{align*}
$$

> Think about why is this so? Start by having a small example, let's say a 4-bit RCA. If we have `A: 0111`, and `B: 0001`, adding both values will result in a **positive overflow**. The true answer to this should be `01000` (signed, means the decimal 8). However since the 4-bit RCA is signed, we have our output as just `1000`, and this means decimal -8 in a signed 4-bit output. Now think about other possible overflow cases (negative overflow, etc).

#### Detailed Adder/Subtractor Schematic

Here’s the detailed schematic of the adder. Please label the nodes yourself before coding them in jsim so that you don’t make typos and end up in a debugging nightmare.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/adder.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">**Write** your answer in the space provided inside `lab3_alu.jsim`, and include `lab3adder.jsim` header to test your adder32 unit only. You can comment out `lab3checkoff.jsim` for the time being. 
</div></div><br>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/5.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

To use the test jig `lab3_testadder.jsim`:

1. Uncomment the `lab3_testadder.jsim` file in the header and comment the rest as such:
   <img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/28.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>
2. Do a **GATE**-level simulation because now we use stdcell library instead of building our own gates using transistor (see [Appendix](https://natalieagus.github.io/50002/lab/lab3#gate-level-simulation))
3. A waveform window showing the adder32 inputs and outputs should appear as such:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/6.png"  class=" center_full"/>

Click the checkoff button (the **green tick** at the upper right window of JSim).

- JSim will check your circuit’s results against a list of expected values and report any discrepancies it finds.
- Use it to debug your component if any error is found.

### Part 2: Compare Unit

Design a 32-bit compare unit that generates one of two constants (`0` or `1`) depending on the `ALUFN` control signals (used to select the comparison to be performed) and the `Z`, `V`, and `N` outputs of the adder/subtractor unit.

<span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">Clearly the high order 31 bits of the output are **always zero** (use that connection to connect `0` in JSim to zero `cmp[31:1]`). The least significant bit of the output is determined by the answer to the **comparison** being performed.
</span>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/7.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

- `ALUFN[2:1]` are used to control the **compare unit**
- Recall that we control the adder/subtractor unit using `ALUFN0` so we cannot use `ALUFN0` to control this compare unit too

**Performance note:**

- The `Z`, `V` and `N` inputs to this circuit can only be calculated by the adder/subtractor unit **after** the 32-bit add is **complete**.
- This means they arrive quite late (takes **tpd** of adder to compute valid `ZVN` signals) and then require further processing in this module, which in turn makes valid `cmp0` shows up after **tpd** of **both** adder and compare units.
- You can speed things up considerably by thinking about the _relative_ timing of `Z`, `V` and `N` and then designing your logic to minimize delay paths involving late-arriving signals.

#### Detailed Compare Unit Schematic

Here’s the detailed schematic of the compare unit:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/8.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">**Write** your answer in the space provided inside `lab3_alu.jsim`. We have created a test jig to test your compare unit: `lab3_testcompare.jsim`. Remember to comment the rest of the test jigs, and only use the compare test jig to test this unit. </div></div><br>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/24.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

### Part 3: Boolean Unit

Design a **32-bit Boolean unit** for the Beta’s logic operations. One implementation of a 32-bit boolean unit uses a **32 copies of a 4-to-1 multiplexer** where `ALUFN0`, `ALUFN1`, `ALUFN2`, and `ALUFN3` **hardcode** the operation to be performed, and `Ai` and `Bi` are hooked to the multiplexer **`SELECT`** inputs. This implementation can produce any of the 16 2-input Boolean functions; but we will only be using 4 of the possibilities: `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `A`.

Here's the general schematic of the Boolean Unit:

> Note the ORDER of the multiplexer **control** signals and its corresponding **output**. See [stdcell documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ArkRewfiBqJGmVqzkiGzFxbS0fZ-2eWw/view?usp=sharing) on the 4-to-1 mux if you’re unsure how these are obtained.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/9.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

The following table shows the encodings for the `ALUFN[3:0]` control signals used by the test jig. If you choose a different implementation you should also include logic to **convert** the supplied control signals into signals appropriate for your design.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/10.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

#### Detailed Boolean Unit Schematic

Here’s the detailed schematic of the Boolean unit:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/11.png"  class=" center_full"/>

In total, you should utilise 32 4-to-1 multiplexers to build the boolean unit. <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">**Please use JSim iterator explained above for this!**</span>

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">**Write** your answer in the space provided inside `lab3_alu.jsim`. We’ve created a test jig to test your boolean unit: `lab3_testboolean.jsim`. Use it to test that your boolean unit works properly. </div></div><br>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/30.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/25.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

### Part 4: Shifter

Design a **32-bit shifter** that implements `SRA`, `SHR` and `SHL` instructions.

- The `A[31:0]` input supplies the data to be shifted
- The **low-order** 5 bits of the `B[4:0]` are used as the **shift count** (i.e., from 0 to 31 bits of shift)
- We do not use the high 27 bits of the `B` input (meaning that `B[31:5]` is **ignored** in this unit)

> For example, if `A: 0x0000 00F0` and we would like to **shift** A to the left by FOUR bits, the `B` input should be `0x0000 0004`

The desired operation will be encoded on `ALUFN[1:0]` as follows:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/12.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

With this encoding, `ALUFN0` is `0` for a **left shift** (SHL) and `1` for a **right shift** (SHR) and `ALUFN1` controls the **sign extension** logic on **right shift**.

- For `SHL` and `SHR`, 0’s are shifted into the vacated bit positions.
- For `SRA` (“shift right arithmetic”), the vacated bit positions are all filled with A31, the sign bit of the original data so that the result will be the same as dividing the original data by the appropriate power of 2.

Here’s the condensed schematic of the left shifter. In total, you should use **32x5 = 160** 2-to-1 multiplexers.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/13.png"  class=" center_full"/>

#### Detailed Shifter Unit Schematic

The simplest implementation is to build THREE shifters: one for shifting **left**, one for shifting **right**, and one for shifting **right arithmetic**. Then, we use a 4-way 32-bit multiplexer to select the appropriate answer as the unit’s output.

It’s easy to build a shifter after noticing that a **multi-bit shift** can be **accomplished** by **cascading** shifts by various powers of 2.

- For example, a 13-bit shift can be implemented by a shift of 8, followed by a shift of 4, followed by a shift of 1.
- So the shifter is just a cascade of multiplexers each controlled by one bit of the shift count.

Here’s the detailed schematic of the **left shifter**.

> That’s really a lot of muxes. Please use the JSim **ITERATOR** for this!

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/14.png"  class=" center_full"/>

Here’s the detailed schematic of the **right shifter**.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/15.png"  class=" center_full"/>

Here’s the detailed schematic of the **right arithmetic shifter**.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/16.png"  class=" center_full"/>

Finally, we can combine all three shifters together to form the total shifter output:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/17.png"  class=" center_full"/>

> Another approach that **adds** latency but **saves** gates is to use the _left shift logic_ for **both** left and right shifts, but for right shifts, **reverse** the bits of the `A` input first on the way in and **reverse** the bits of the output on the way out.

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">**Write** your answer in the space provided inside `lab3_alu.jsim`. We have created a test jig to test your shift unit: `lab3_testshifter.jsim`. Use it to test that your shifter unit works properly.  </div></div><br>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/31.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/26.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

## Task B: Studying the Multiplier

Open `lab3_mult.jsim` and realise that this file contains the circuitry for a **multiplier unit**.

The goal of this section is to study this particular combinational multiplier that accepts 32-bit operands (`A`, `B`) and produces a 32-bit output. **Multiplying two 32-bit numbers produces a 64-bit product;** the result we’re looking for is **just the low-order 32-bits of the 64-bit product.**

Here is a detailed bit-level description of how a **4-bit** by **4-bit** unsigned multiplication works. This diagram assumes **we only want the low-order 4 bits** of the 8-bit product.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/18.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

This diagram can be **extended** in a straightforward way to 32-bit by 32-bit multiplication.

> Remember again that since our machine is only 32-bit, that means we only can store the low-order 32-bits of the result, you don’t need to include the circuitry that generates the rest of the 64-bit product.

As you can see from the diagram above, forming the _partial products_ is easy. Multiplication of two bits can be implemented using an `AND` gate. The hard **and VERY TEDIOUS part** is adding up all the partial products **(there will be 32 partial products in your circuit)**. O

- One can use full adders (FAs) hooked up in a ripple-carry configuration to add each partial product to the accumulated sum of the previous partial products (see the diagram below)
- The circuit closely follows the diagram above but omits an FA module if two of its inputs are `0`

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/19.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

### Multiplier Analysis

The circuit above works with both **unsigned** operands and **signed** two’s complement operands. <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">This may seem strange – don’t we have to worry about the most significant bit (MSB) of the operands?</span> With unsigned operands the MSB has a weight of $$2^{MSB}$$ (assuming the bits are numbered 0 to MSB) but with signed operands the MSB has a weight of $$-2^{MSB}$$. Doesn’t our circuitry need to take that into account?

<span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">It does, but when we are only saving the lower half of the product, the differences don’t appear. </span>

The multiplicand (`A` in the figure above) can be **either** unsigned or two’s complement (signed), and the FA circuits will perform correctly in either case.

- When the multiplier (`B` in the figure above) is signed, we should **subtract** the final partial product instead of adding it.
- But **subtraction** is the **same as adding the negative**, and the negative of a two’s complement number can be computed by taking its complement and adding 1.
- When we work this through we see that the **low-order bit of the partial product is the same whether positive or negated**.
- And the low-order bit is **ALL** that we need when saving only the lower half of the product
- If we were building a multiplier that computed the full product, we’d see many differences between a multiplier that handles unsigned operands and one that handles two’s complement operands, but these differences only affect how the high half of the product is computed.

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">
We’ve provided a test file `lab3multiply.jsim `to help you **study** the schematic and output of the multiplier. 
</div></div>

> This test file includes test cases for:

- all combinations of $$(0, 1, -1)*(0,1,-1)$$,
- $$2i*1$$ for $$i = 0, 1, …, 31$$ (positive)
- $$-1*2i$$ for $$i = 0, 1, …, 31$$ (negative)
- $$(3 << i) * 3$$ for $$i = 0, 1, …, 31 $$

<div class="greenbox"><div class="custom_box">**Design Note:** Combinational multipliers implemented as described above are pretty slow!  There are many design tricks we can use to speed things up – see the appendix on “Computer Arithmetic” in any of the editions of **Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach** by John Hennessy and David Patterson (Morgan Kauffmann publishers). </div></div><br>

## Task C: Combine all units and make the ALU

Combine the outputs of the finished **adder**, **multiplier** (given), **compare**, **boolean** and **shift** units to produce a single `ALU` output: `ALU[31:0]`. The simplest approach is to use a 4-way 32-bit multiplexer as shown in the schematic below:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/20.png"  class=" center_full"/>

Two additional control signals (`ALUFN[5:4]`) have been introduced to select which unit will supply the value for the ALU output. The encodings for `ALUFN[5:0]` used by the test jig `lab3checkoff.jsim` are shown in the following table:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/21.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

Note that the `Z`, `V`, and `N` signals from the adder/subtractor unit are **INCLUDED** in the terminal list for the alu subcircuit (<span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">counted as ALU’s output</span>). **You should also have these signals as the ALU output for your 1D Project**. While these signals are NOT needed when using the ALU as part of the Beta, they are included here to make it easier for the test jig to pinpoint problems with your circuit.

<div class="yellowbox"><div class="custom_box">**Write** your answer in the space provided inside `lab3_alu.jsim`. When you’ve completed your design, you can use `lab3checkoff.jsim` to test your ALU implementation including the multiplier. </div></div><br>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/32.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/27.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

When you run the gate-level simulation, you should see the following plot pops up:
<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/23.png"  class=" center_full"/>

You can use it to debug your alu by finding the opcode that causes the error once you tried to verify (click the tick sign).

If all expected values are correct, you should see the following window pops up after you click the tick sign:

## Appendix: JSim Tricks

### Standard Cell Library

The building blocks for our design will be a family of **logic gates that are part of a standard cell library**, declared for you in the file called `stdcell.jsim` given in your courseware. [You can find its documentation here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ArkRewfiBqJGmVqzkiGzFxbS0fZ-2eWw&authuser=nn88blue%40gmail.com&usp=drive_fs). The available combinational gates are listed in the table below along with information about their **timing**, **loading** and **size**. You can access the library by starting your netlist with the following include statements:

```cpp
.include "nominal.jsim"
.include "stdcell.jsim"
```

<div class="redbox"><div class="custom_box">We will no longer need to create custom gates from scratch using MOSFET, unlike in our Lab 1 and 2. From **now onwards**, please build your combinational logic devices using the gates provided in `stdcell.jsim`.</div></div><br>

### Gate-level Simulation

Since we are designing at the **gate level** we can use a **faster** simulator that only knows about gates and logic values (<span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">instead of transistors and voltages</span>).

> You can run JSim’s gate-level simulator by clicking the GATE button in the JSim toolbar. DO NOT click the transient analysis button anymore.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/1.png"  class=" center_full"/>

_Note that your design **cannot** contain any mosfets, resistors, capacitors, etc.; this simulator only supports the gate primitives in the standard cell library._

Inputs are still **specified in terms of voltages** (to maintain netlist compatibility with the other simulators) but the gate-level simulator converts voltages into one of three possible logic values using the Vil and Vih thresholds specified in nominal.jsim:

- `0` logic low (voltages less than or equal to VIL threshold)
- `1` logic high (voltages greater than or equal to VIH threshold)
- `X` unknown or undefined (voltages between the thresholds, or unknown voltages)
- `Z` the value of nodes that aren’t being driven by any gate output (e.g., the outputs of tristate drivers that aren’t enabled).

The following diagram shows how these values appear on the waveform display:
<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab3/2.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

### .connect in JSim

JSim has a control statement that lets you connect two or more nodes together so that they behave as a **single** electrical node:

```cpp
.connect node1 node2 node3...
```

The `.connect` statement is useful for connecting two terminals of a subcircuit or for connecting nodes directly to ground. For example, the following statement ties nodes `cmp1, cmp2, ..., cmp31` directly to the ground node (node `0`):

```cpp
.connect 0 cmp[31:1]
```

### .connect Warning

Note that the `.connect` control statement in JSim works differently than many people expect: it **does NOT connect element-wise** For example,

```cpp
.connect A[5:0] B[5:0]
```

will connect all twelve nodes (`A5, A4, ..., A0, B5, B4, ..., B0`) **TOGETHER**. It is essentially like soldering all 12 pins together, instead of connecting them element-wise. To connect the two buses element-wise, you should use:

```cpp
.connect A5 B5
.connect A4 B4
.connect A3 B3
.connect A2 B2
.connect A1 B1
.connect A0 B0
```

### Bus unit

The above can be **tedious** to type. To fix this, you can define a two-terminal device that is used internally, and then use the usual **iteration** rules (see next section) to make many instances of the device with one `X` (device) statement:

```cpp
* declare bus subcircuit
.subckt bus a b
.connect a b
.ends

* use bus subcircuit to connect A and B buses element-wise
X1 A[5:0] B[5:0] bus
```

To make it convenient for your, there exist the `bus` unit inside `stdcell.jsim` that will come in handy to duplicate certain nodes for you with a different name. It is defined as such:

```cpp
.subckt bus a b
.connect a b
.ends
```

Therefore if you want to duplicate node `a[31:0]` into node `b[31:0]`, simply state (position of `a` and `b` can be interchangeable, it does not matter):

```cpp
Xbusab a[31:0] b[31:0] bus
```

Then you can utilise node `b[31:0]` afterwards.

### JSim Iterators

JSim makes it **easy** to specify **multiple gates** with a single `"X"` statement.

> You can create multiple instances of a device by supplying some multiple of the number of nodes it expects, e.g., if a device has 3 terminals, supplying 9 nodes will create 3 instances of the device.

For example, a device called `xor` with 3 terminals: two inputs and one outputs (**POSITIONAL ARGUMENT**) can be instantiated 3 times in a single instruction as such:

```cpp
Xtest a[2:0] b[2:0] z[2:0] xor2
```

is equivalent to:

```cpp
Xtest#0 a2 b2 z2 xor2
Xtest#1 a1 b1 z1 xor2
Xtest#2 a0 b0 z0 xor2
```

### Duplicating a signal

There is also a handy way of duplicating a signal. For example, xor-ing a 4-bit bus with a control signal `ctl` could be written as

```cpp
Xbusctl in[3:0] ctl#4 out[3:0] xor2
```

which is equivalent to:

```cpp
Xbusctl#0 in3 ctl out3 xor2
Xbusctl#1 in2 ctl out2 xor2
Xbusctl#2 in1 ctl out1 xor2
Xbusctl#3 in0 ctl out0 xor2
```

### Connecting Multiple Nodes to ground

Using iterators and the “constant0” device from the standard cell library, here’s a better way of connecting a sample 32-bit bus `a[31:0]` to ground:

```cpp
Xgnd a[31:0] constant0
```

`constant0` is a device defined in standard cell library and it has only one terminal (just one input and no output). This is equivalent to:

```cpp
Xgnd#0 a31 constant0
Xgnd#1 a30 constant0
Xgnd#2 a29 constant0
...
Xgnd#31 a0 constant0
```

> The effect of doing this is that `a[31:0]` will **always** give an output of `0` since it is **connected to ground**. It is a convenient way to _zero_ unused output ports.

### Optimising Circuitry

There are many gates that are available in the standard cell library. We can use any gates to synthesize any logic device. However, when designing circuits there are three separate factors that can be optimised:

1. Design for **maximum performance** (minimum latency)
2. Design for **minimum cost** (minimum area)
3. Design for the best cost / performance **ratio** (minimise area \* latency)

It is often possible to do all three at once but in some portions of the circuit some sort of _design tradeoff_ will need to be made. When designing your circuitry you should **choose** which of these three factors is most **important** to you and optimize your design (use the correct gates) accordingly. You will have to make such design choices in your 2D project.
