## 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder

Your mission this week is to design and test a CMOS circuit that performs addition on **TWO** **_UNSIGNED_** <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">4-bit inputs</span>: `A[3:0], B[3:0]`, producing a <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">5-bit output</span> `S[4:0]`:

## Task A: Building Logic Gates XOR and XNOR (50 mins)

Since logic gates are used to implement the logic for the full adder, a good place to start is to:

- Build your own gate library (e.g., inverter, 2-input `nand`, 2-input `nor`, `inv`, 2-input `xnor`, 2-input `xor`),
- Test them individually, then
- Use them to implement your design.

We have given you a headstart by implementing 2-input `nand`, 2-input `nor`, and `inv` for you inside `lab2_submit.jsim`. Now you just need to implement 2-input `xnor` and 2-input `xor` gates.

## XOR and XNOR Gate Schematic

It’s much easier to debug your circuit module-by-module rather than as one big lump. XOR/XNOR can be challenging gates to design; here’s one suggestion for how they might be implemented. Use PFET with specs: SW as 4 and SL as 1, and NFET with specs: SW as 2 and SL as 1.

## Task B: Simple 1-bit Adder (30 mins)

Let’s start a simple **1-bit full-adder** module before proceeding to create a 4-bit Ripple-Carry adder. Later we will discuss higher performance adder architectures you can use in the implementation of the Beta (the computer central processing unit we will be designing in later labs).

The full adder module has **3 inputs** (`A`, `B`, and `Ci`) and **2 outputs** (`S` and `Co`). The logic equations and truth tables for S and Co are shown below.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/5.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

**Logic Equation:**

$$
\begin{align}
S &= A \oplus B \oplus C_{i} \\
C_{o}  &= A \cdot B + A \cdot C_{i} + B \cdot C_i
\end{align}
$$

Hints:

- S is typically implemented using two cascaded 2-input XOR gates.
- You can use three 2-input NANDs and one 3-input NAND to implement Co (remember that by De Morgan’s Law, two cascaded NANDs are logically equivalent to a cascade of AND/OR).

## Ripple-Carry Adder

We can cascade FA units to form Ripple-Carry Adder. The module performs the addition of two one-bit inputs (`A` and `B`) incorporating the carry in from the **previous** stage (`Ci`). The result appears on the `S` output and a carry (`Co`) is generated for the **next** stage.

A possible schematic for the 4-bit adder is shown below:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/6.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

We have implemented this part for you inside `lab2_submit.jsim`. Please study it.

## Testing your Circuit

The file `lab2_debug.jsim` contains code to debug and test your circuit. **You DO NOT need to submit this file.**

You can use the file `8clocks.jsim` which can be included in your netlist to generate test waveforms for your circuits. It provides eight different **square** waves (50% duty cycle) with different periods:

```cpp
clk1	period = 10ns
clk2  	period = 20ns
clk3  	period = 40ns
clk4  	period = 80ns
clk5  	period = 160ns
clk6  	period = 320ns
clk7  	period = 640ns
clk8  	period = 1280ns
```

For example, to completely test all possible input combinations for a 2-input gate, you could connect `clk1` and `clk2` to the two inputs and simulate for `20ns`. See `lab2_debug.jsim` file for example. You can open `lab2_debug.jsim` and click the **Fast Transient Analysis** button. <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">Comment out the line `.include "lab2checkoff.jsim"` in `lab2_submit.jsim` if you want to plot these **debug plots** instead of the **checkoff plots**. Don't forget to uncomment back this line for your final submission.</span>.

Below is a screenshot on the contents of `lab2_submit.jsim`:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/8.png"  class=" center_fifty"/>

- In `lab2_debug.jsim`, we use `clk1`, `clk2`, and `clk3` to create signals for `A`, `B`, and `Ci` using an **inverter** (you can use a buffer too, it doesn't really matter).
- Since each clock period is _double_ the previous one, we will be able to create **all** 8 input combinations: `000, 001, …, 111` using these three clocks.
- Then we plug in `A`, `B`, and `Ci` signals to FA, getting its output: `S`, and `Co`.
- Afterwards, we plot them (line 11-15).

Once you are somewhat confident that your circuit works properly, go to `lab2_submit.jsim` and click the **Fast Transient Analysis** (not device level simulation!) button. A window as such should pop up:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/12.png"  class="center_full"/>
This plot represents all signals produced by `s[4:0]` given various `a` and `b` values as time progresses (time is the x-axis). You can **zoom** in to see the plots better.

Click on the top right hand corner green tick button to check if all values are as expected. If everything works correctly, this window should pop up:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/13.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

## Appendix: Interpreting analogue signal levels using JSim

Interpreting analog signal levels as logic values can be **tedious**. For a given signal `a`, JSim will do it for you automatically if you ask to plot `L(a)` instead of just `a`. The logic-high and logic-thresholds are determined by the `vih` and `vil` options:

```cpp
.options vih=2.6 vil=0.6
```

These values are **already** specified in `nominal.jsim`, but you can override them in your own netlist. Voltages between `vil` and `vih` are displayed as a filled-in rectangle to indicate that the logic value cannot be determined (**invalid** values). For example:

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/9.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>

You can also ask for the values of a set of signals to be displayed as a bus, e.g., `L(a3,a2,a1,a0)`. The signals should be listed, **most-significant bit first**. A bus waveform is displayed as a:

1. **Filled-rectangle** if any of the component signals has an **invalid** logic level or
2. As a hexadecimal value if it has a **valid** logic level.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/10.png"  class=" center_seventy"/>
<br><br>
There are three sections to the above plot:
1. Initially, the four signals `a3`, `a2`, `a1` and `a0` are interpreted as a **4-bit integer** with initial value of `1111 (0xF)`. 
2. Then, since x-axis represents **time**, the high-order bit (`a3`) is making a 1→0 transition. 
  * The filled-in rectangle represents the **period of time** during which `a3` transitions from **Vih** to **Vil**, rendering them ALL invalid denoted in the shaded rectangle 
  * <span style="background-color:yellow; color: black">If one signal is invalid, all signals in the bus will be deemed invalid as a shaded box!</span>,
3. After the highest bit made a transition to zero completely, and the value of L ultimately became valid `0111 (0x7)`.
<br><br>
Below is the screenshot of the JSIM plot that you will see after you complete your code and would like to test the answer. You can use the plot to check if your code implements the functional specification of a 4-bit adder correctly. Each row is a plot of the values of the terminals over time. For simplicity, they’re **represented** in **hex** instead of in binary.

<img src="/50002-2022/assets/contentimage/lab2/11.png"  class="center_full"/>

<br><br>
**You can represent `a` which is just 1 bit in hex too**. The value of `a` is periodically changed between 1 and 0 (but when represented as hex it becomes 0x1 and 0x0 respectively even though `a` is ONE bit).

**Another example:**

- If signal `b` is 3 bits in length with a value of `101`, the hex representation is `0x5`
- If signal `c` is 6 bits in length with a value of `11111`, the hex representation is `0x3F`

The above plot is merely a digital value representation of the signal in hex.

- The value of `b` and `ci` is initially 0
- The **expected** **output** when `a=1`, `b=1`, and `ci = 1` is `s=1` and `c0=1`. **We know this from the truth table.**
- The plot confirms that this is **true** since the values of `s` and `c0` are shown to indeed be 1 given that combination of `a=1`, `b=1`, and `ci=1` (bottom two rows)
